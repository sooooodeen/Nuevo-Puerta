// PHPMailer main class (autoloaded if using Composer)
// This is a placeholder. In production, download PHPMailer from https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer or use Composer:
// composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
// Then include the autoloader or require the files as needed.
// For now, this file is a stub to indicate where PHPMailer would be placed.
